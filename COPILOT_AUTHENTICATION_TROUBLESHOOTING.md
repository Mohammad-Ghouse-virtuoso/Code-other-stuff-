# GitHub Copilot Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Summary
This document addresses GitHub Copilot authentication issues in VS Code, particularly when there are billing/subscription concerns.

## Your Current Situation
Based on the error messages and screenshots:
- ✅ GitHub account is connected to VS Code
- ❌ Copilot authentication loop (repeatedly asked to sign in)
- ⚠️ Billing warning: Payment overdue, due by October 14, 2025
- ℹ️ Certificate message: "Removed 3 expired certificates" (this is normal maintenance)

## Root Cause
**The authentication issue is most likely caused by the overdue payment status on your GitHub account.** GitHub Copilot requires an active, paid subscription, and when billing issues occur, access may be restricted even before the stated deadline.

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Resolve Billing Issue (RECOMMENDED)
This is the most likely fix for your authentication problem:

1. **Make the overdue payment:**
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/billing
   - Click "Make a payment" or update your payment method
   - Clear any outstanding balance

2. **Wait 5-10 minutes** after payment for the system to update

3. **Restart VS Code completely** (not just reload window)

4. **Try authenticating again**

### 2. Clear VS Code Authentication State
If payment is resolved but authentication still fails:

```bash
# Close VS Code completely first, then:

# On Windows:
rmdir /s "%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\github.copilot"
rmdir /s "%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\github.copilot-chat"

# On macOS:
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/globalStorage/github.copilot
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/globalStorage/github.copilot-chat

# On Linux:
rm -rf ~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/github.copilot
rm -rf ~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/github.copilot-chat
```

Then restart VS Code and sign in again.

### 3. Revoke and Re-authorize OAuth Access

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/applications
2. Find "Visual Studio Code" in the list
3. Click "Revoke" to remove access
4. In VS Code, sign out of GitHub completely
5. Sign back in and authorize Copilot again

### 4. Verify Copilot Subscription Status

Check your subscription independently:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/copilot
2. Verify subscription status shows "Active"
3. Check that billing is current at https://github.com/settings/billing

## About the Certificate Message

The message `Removed 3 expired certificates` is **normal** and **not the cause** of your issue. This is routine certificate cleanup that VS Code performs automatically.

## If Problems Persist

### Contact GitHub Support
Since this appears to be billing-related:
1. Visit https://support.github.com/contact
2. Select "Billing" as the topic
3. Explain the situation and reference your overdue payment
4. Ask about Copilot access during billing resolution

### Alternative: GitHub Community Discussion
- Visit https://github.com/community/community/discussions
- Search for similar authentication issues
- Post in the "Copilot" category if needed

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't repeatedly try to authenticate - this won't help
❌ Don't reinstall VS Code - unlikely to fix billing issues
❌ Don't create multiple GitHub accounts - violates terms of service
❌ Don't expect Copilot to work until billing is resolved

## Expected Timeline

- **After payment**: 5-10 minutes for access restoration
- **Without payment**: Access will remain blocked
- **Subscription grace period**: Usually none for overdue payments

## Prevention

To avoid this in the future:
1. Set up automatic payment method
2. Keep payment information current
3. Monitor billing notifications
4. Check https://github.com/settings/billing regularly
